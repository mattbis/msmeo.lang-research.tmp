.. time to decide properly 

0. going to start with some explorations I feel... since I need this tool.. must I am very undecided on how much
additional dev work I wanna give myself... and maybe keeping to a scripting only type solutions. ( since we can do some quite interesting computing now with parallel things ) 

However the formats mean working with real libaries and that is the only way... so a basic compilation of certain lib/ parts is needed.. 

factors
1. numbers of coders 
2. my expertise, what i will take on or need help with > at first mostly all of it.. depending on the complexity.. 
3. what i like in systems or not ; what fun stuff to do extra
4. the deps
5. must do certain difficult stuff: negotiation is not possible
6. prior state-of-art
7. future considerations
8. most new languages dont have this stuff... 
9. many libraries exists
10. artefact considerations
11. code efficiency
12. who i can get to help me
13. how much time we have.. 
14. amount of gh and tooling overhead
15. avoiding evil software patents
16. attracting proper experts..

 probably:
 
 go - tooling, config
 rs - app build, manifest, dep imp, bev, os
 c - maybe the base layer with cosmo
 js - how you interact with e during operation in bli editor and change something when playing around.. maybe.. probably quickjs from cosmo
