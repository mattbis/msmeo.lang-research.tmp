.. time to decide properly 

0. going to start with some explorations I feel... since I need this tool.. must I am very undecided on how much
additional dev work I wanna give myself... and maybe keeping to a scripting only type solutions.

factors
1. numbers of coders 
2. my expertise, what i will take on or need help with > at first mostly all of it.. depending on the complexity.. 
3. what i like in systems or not
4. the deps
5. must do certain difficult stuff: negotiation is not possible
6. prior state-of-art
7. future considerations
8. most new languages dont have this stuff... 
9. many libraries exists
10. artefact considerations
11. code efficiency
12. who i can get to help me
13. how much time we have.. 
14. amount of gh and tooling overhead
15. avoiding evil software patents
16. attracting proper experts..
